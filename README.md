Official code base repository for "3D MRI Synthesis with Slice-Based Latent Diffusion Models: Improving Tumor Segmentation Tasks in Data-Scarce Regimes"
- **Accepted at ISBI2024**
- Arxiv paper will be available soon.  

This repository is based on openai/improved-diffusion ([Link](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)) official repository and medfusion public repository ([Link](https://github.com/mueller-franzes/medfusion)).  
The code is modified to fit the needs of the project.
